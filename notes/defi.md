## Balancer

The assembly block code gives solidity developer the shortcut ways to interact with virtual machines. Since all of operation codes are not provided by high-level API, these exceptional opcodes can be directly used through asm code block. The normal codes are compiled into assembly codes in the final step. The compiler is responsible for this translation work. The compiler may be updated behind than operation codes in the virtual machine. The asm code block is introduced to solve this conflicts as well as optimization chance.

The import action can be performed in full elements or partial elements ways. The only needed source items are imported. This is the basic rule for import statement. The function set are placed together in the name of library. These function set are attached to custom or specific types by using for directive. The main purpose of library functions is to make computations. These calculations may be done in the function body directly or by the assistance of other functions.
