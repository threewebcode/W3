## Balancer

The assembly block code gives solidity developer the shortcut ways to interact with virtual machines. Since all of operation codes are not provided by high-level API, these exceptional opcodes can be directly used through asm code block. The normal codes are compiled into assembly codes in the final step. The compiler is responsible for this translation work. The compiler may be updated behind than operation codes in the virtual machine. The asm code block is introduced to solve this conflicts as well as optimization chance.
