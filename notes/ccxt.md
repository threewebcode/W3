# CCXT Guide

The ccxt is a project that can be used to operate with different kinds of crypto exchanges. It provides both of public APIs and private APIs. There is a base exchange class and all exchanges can derive from the base exchange class. If you want to interact with a specific exchange, the instance should be created for that exchange.


There are several alternatives to ccxt for accessing cryptocurrency exchange APIs, including:

1. Crypto-JS-Library: A JavaScript library that provides functions to interact with various cryptocurrency exchanges, including placing orders, getting market data, and managing funds.

2. Coinbase Pro API: An official API provided by Coinbase for accessing their trading platform, allowing developers to place orders, manage funds, and retrieve market data.

3. Binance API: An official API provided by Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, offering programmatic access to their trading platform.

4. Bitfinex API: An official API provided by Bitfinex for accessing their trading platform, allowing for programmatic trading and data retrieval.

5. CoinGecko API: A comprehensive, simple and robust API for cryptocurrency market data, offering live pricing, historical data, and exchange information for thousands of cryptocurrencies and exchanges.

These are just a few examples, but there are many other alternatives available depending on the specific needs and requirements of your project.
