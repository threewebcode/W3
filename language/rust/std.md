The macro rules are a functional macro embedded in the rust compiler. The power of macro functions can be used to create new and customo macro rules for language syntax. The macro is a feature and powerful tool in the Rust language that provides one kind of abstraction as well as code generation during the compilation period. 

The macro has different aspects such as creation, styles and invocation. The macro has name and code block. There is anonymous function or closure function inside the block body. The input parameters of macro process function are special and language segment orientation. The syntax and type are captured and operated by the macro function.

The type and regular expression is used to parse and analyze the input arguments. The different pieces are split and manipulated to new form. The process from the operation system is implemented by the command structure in the rust language.
