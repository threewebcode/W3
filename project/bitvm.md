# BitVM

The current bitcoin crates are leveraged to create high-level syntax constructs. The stack variable has the properties of identity and storage size. The stack operations are described by enumeration type. Both of main stack and alternative stack are existed in the bitcoin script design. The stack data represents the data on the stack. The storage location, bytes size and state change are its main characteristics.
