The height and blocker header must be verified according to the data composition relationship between them and inside their internals. The data object is defined and used for its validate state and wrong cases. If the data is in line with misbehavior characteristics, the negative edges are encountered and processed.

The function is pure function. It does not have state. Its purpose is to do operations and call methods from input parameters. The storage layer is able to get the store object and get client state from store object. The old data should be prunned before migration. The cosmos has inter-chain standard for cross-chain operations. The codec, type, error components have their own directory and packages. 

The merkle tree is the proof mechanism. The tree node state can be verified by tree root hash and state path. The state can be the member of state tree or it is not the member. The codec is responsible for data serialization and deserialization.
