# Assembly Code

The word is byte unit. 32 bytes is a word. The contract is linked object and runtime object. The assembly concept is presented by its interface and implmentation. The assemblyer manages the assembly items. The assembly can output in the json format. The assembly item is tagged by its id. 

The assembly item has its size, arguments and return value properties. The object format in the memory can be conveted into string format. The type of assembly item is described by the enumeration data type. The share content in the assembly item can be optimized.

If the equal subexpression is found, two or more subexpressions can be eliminated. The constant variables have a way to be optimized. The control flow is portayed in the graph data structure. The block has the block id, start position, end position, state pointers attributes. The disassembly is able to transform the codes from byte codes to assembly string format code.
