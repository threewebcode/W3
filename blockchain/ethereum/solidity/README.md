# Solidity Language

The solidity language provides the executable binary which can compile the solidity source codes. This is achieved by the main function. The constant keyword in the c++ language means that it keeps unchanged during the execution. If the reference is mutated, certain error should be thrown. The double colon is a scope resolver in the c++ language. 

The contract can convert to operation codes and assembly codes. The contract can be transformed to intermediate representation. The application binary interface of the contract can be output in the json format. The gas can be estimated on the basis of contract information. 

Every node in the abstract syntax tree can be visited and transformed to other data strcture and format. The source unit represents one unit in the source code file. The unit may be large or small. The whole file may be regarded as one unit. The abstract syntax tree can be acted as one unit. The abstract synatx tree can be constructued from the json format. The item in the json format can be converted into the tree node of abstract syntax tree. 

The source unit has the source file name and path. It has node list as well as license information and experimental features. The node is visited from root node to chile nodes. When the root node is visited, the node process is beginning. When the child nodes are visited and processed, the end callback will be invoked to do post operations. 

The visitor is accepted by the node and the node acts as the input parameter of visit method. The visit method will transform the syntax node to other format. 

The enumeration type is used to describe the experimental features. The constructor function is harnessed to control the behaviors of the class's instances. The different types are defined and their fields and behaviors are described.
