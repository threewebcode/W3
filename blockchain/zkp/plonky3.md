The implement block is used to associate functions with struct type. The variables, types and function sigantures can be declared in the trait type. The trait can also restrict what kinds of data fields its implementations must own. Poseidon is a cryptographic hash function specifically designed for zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) systems, like zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs. Poseidon is a hash function built for the ZK era, using a sponge structure and Hades permutation to minimize circuit complexity over prime fields. Its "extended series"—notably Poseidon2—enhances this with optimized linear layers and attack resistance, pushing the envelope on speed and practicality.

The crate is pointed to current crate which is current package. The core crate has the arithmetic operations and product/sum operation over iteration. The array type in Rust language has field element type and element quantity. The Self keyword stands for struct type iteself. The self keyword represents the instance of struct type.The mathematical calculations are implemented by Rust language.
