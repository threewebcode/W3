# RISC ZERO

The cryptographic functions are implemented by the circuits. The program is executed against the cryptographic  functions and the receipts are collected for proofing. The merkle root is one kind of proof. The Groth16 prover and verifier are implemented by rust language and used in this project.

The modules are defined in the library source file. The module name appears in the current scope. The functions are defined in this module. When this module is loaded and resolved, the items can be used directly. Various functions are created to handle different data types and do the mathematic computation. 

The seal object is structure type and holds three fields that represent the composition of a seal. The seal should know the element size and group size. The values and curve are expressed in the format of json. The vector data type is frequently used to stand for the data. The structure and vector data instance are the valid data input of enumeration types.

The docker container technology is leveraged to do the calculation task. The independent calculation is wrappedin the docker image. The docker image is invoked as language shell command to do this computation work. The seal is a special and complex data structure. It is particular for field elements. The verify key, proof and prepared inputs are three fragments of the verifier. The verifier does this verification work of checking the mathematic relationship between its three ingredients.

The source code items are included in the file and they are scoped according to the language rules. The foreignfunction interface is utilized to glue the c mathematics library with current rust codes. The events are tracked for instruction, register and memory operations. The segment includes all the information about the pre state, post state, system calls, input digest and output digest. 

Heterogeneous architecture layer is supported and central process unit, universal device architecture are adopted as well as the metal machine. These are related to hardware side and its implementations. The emunator is written in the software to simulate the hardware interfaces. 

The zk virtual machine emulates a small risc-v computer, allowing it to run any arbitrary codes in any language. The program is represented by a method. During the execution of method, the guest and host inside the virtual machine can communicate with each other.

The command line application is created and each command is represented as one instance of enumeration types.The concrete command class is wrapped as the value inside the enumeration type. When the enumeration is matched, the instance of concrete command is executed in the corresponding branch. 

The struct type can have no field in the rust language. The environment and execution program is needed when calling the prove method of the host server. The proof receipt is received as the result. The receipt is equal to the proof. The zk virtual machine and method are involved in this process.

The different functions are used to compute the control id. If the program is recursive program, the control id is calculated in the manner of merkle proof. The program is in the format of elf form and the program image id is produced on the basis of program elf data. The program data structure in the rust language is created to represent and describe the elf program. When the elf program is read and loaded, its data can be parsed and used to manufacture the program object.

The data like struct, list and iterator can tagged which means that the tag string is hashed and added into the whole data. As a result, the data types can be verified. The build arguments and options are different for different languages and platforms. 

The polynomial arithemetics, bit operation, digest mathematics are included in the zero knowledge protocol. Thedigest hash function has several implementation and algorithm. The zkp directory is all about the protocol level. The bottom layer under the protocol is the circuit implementation. 

The system call is described by the rust language and linked with c library code, passed to kernel through c functions.
