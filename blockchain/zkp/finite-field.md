# Finite Field

There are q elements as a set in the finite field. The number q may be a prime or prime power. The element in the finite field has its inverse element. The result of the element and its inverse element is equal to one. The elements in the finite field can perform addition, multiplication and division operations. The result is still in the finite field when the result modulus the q number.
