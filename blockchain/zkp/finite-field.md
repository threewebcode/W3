# Finite Field

The finite field can be used to solve the equation. The equation may have infinite solution, but the finite field system just provide finite known solution to an equation. This makes equation solveation more practical in the real case. To some extent, the equation is equal to function. The elliptic curve has an important feature. The multiplicatin operation is easy, but it is hard to compute the division to know the factor. This characterstic fits cryptography really well.

There are q elements as a set in the finite field. The number q may be a prime or prime power. The element in the finite field has its inverse element. The result of the element and its inverse element is equal to one. The elements in the finite field can perform addition, multiplication and division operations. The result is still in the finite field when the result modulus the q number.
