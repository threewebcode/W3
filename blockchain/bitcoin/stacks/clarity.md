# Clarity

The module is file module. The items in the external crates are brought into current scope by the use keyword. The constant variables are declared in the form of `variable name plus colon plus type`. There are buffer, list and principal data. The contract is identified by its issuer and contract name. The value type is enumerated to stand for different allowed types in the contract.

The function items can be associated with the enumeration type. The asset is associated with the smart contract and its clarity name. The structure type is defined with its member fields and methods which are its state andoperations. Each type has its own format signature. The type is recognized and their relationships are parsed. The pivotal object in the clarity language is the virtual machine which can execute the smart contract.

The modules are nested and have the relative position and reference relationship. There are user function, native function and special function for the callable type in the clarity contract. The virtual machine finds the process function for the callable data. The clarity codes are parsed, analyzed and interpreted by the virtual machine. 

The environment and database are the context and dependent objects for the clarity virtual machine. The claritysmart contract are analyzed and stored into the database. The enironment is composed of global context, contract context, call stack, sender, caller and sponsor. When the transaction is executed, the result is returned with the inclusion of result, events and costs.
