# Improvement Proposal

The proposal covers the four aspects of blockchain network: design, implementation, operation and governance. The categories are divided into technical and non-technical aspects. The technical side includes the consensus mechanism, peer to peer network, transaction and block, smart contract language and virtual machine. The non-technical facet contains the tokenomics and governance.
