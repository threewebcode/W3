# Stacks

When the address and block is confirmed, the payment is finalized. In a single block, all of actions are finished in the lock step. The stacks uses the bitcoin as the anchoring chain. 

A hash of each block is recorded to the return operation code of the bitcoin transaction. A new block might be mined once per bitcoin block. A miner must have a block commit included in a bitcoin block. If a miner wished to update his commitment after submission, he may use the bitcoin replace by fee transaction.

The clarity is the smart contract language of stack network. It is interpreted programming language. It is human readable and decidable.
