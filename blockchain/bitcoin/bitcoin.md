# BitCoin

The transaction version determines transaction structure. The basic transaction structure includes transaction input, output and witness. The validity of transaction structure can be checked according to transaction version. The transaction types are evolved from legacy types to other advancded types. The original public key is replaced by public key hash or tweaked public key. To make it more dynamic, the public key can be replaced by a redeem script. The formated script can spend the bitcoin output.
